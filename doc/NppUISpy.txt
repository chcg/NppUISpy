============
  Features
============

With this plugin you can explore the main menu structure and the toolbar of
Notepad++ to figure out which menu command ids are assigned to menu items and
toolbar buttons.

Menu items are displayed as a tree structure and toolbar buttons as a list. You
can left-click on both kind of items to execute the related command.

With a right click to the items a context menu pops up where you can select to
copy the item's icon, its text or its menu command id to the clipboard.

Both the menu item tree and the toolbar button list provide full-text search.
Start typing while one of them is focused to make the first matching item
getting highlighted.

For advanced searching in both trees you can use the search UI controls. Select
the tree to search in by clicking on its header row or by checking the option
box beneath the tree. The search term input field provides a search history.

When pressing the ALT key, the UI shows underlined characters that can be
pressed together with the ALT key to control the UI by keyboard. Additionally,

when the search term input field has input focus, you can press ENTER to search

forwards and CTRL+ENTER to search backwards.
